### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

## Profile:
My name is **Charis** born 1/6/2003(d/m/y),
i'm a young self motivated developer currently
working as a coffe delivery, with a 
passion for the cyber-security industry.
I started by learning html when i was 15 and since then have 
improved my skills and expanded my knowledge and went from front-end
to back-end 

```python
from time import sleep

class Developer:
  def __init__(self):
    self.drinksCoffe = False
    self.hasntSlept = False

  def drinkCoffe(self):
    if not self.drinksCoffe:
      print("Drinking Coffe")
      self.drinksCoffe = True
      sleep(1)
    return

  def unSleep(self):
    if not self.hasntSlept:
      print("uNSLeeling nOw")
      self.hasntSlept = True
      sleep(1)
    return

  def code(self):
    if self.drinksCoffe and self.hasntSlept:
      for i in range(1,10):
        print("Coding"+ "."*i)
        sleep(.5)
    else:
      print("Dev instance can't code bcs it's healthy\nRun unSleep() and drinkCoffe() first to proceed")
      sleep(.5)
      return
    print("="*4 +"Finished" + "="*4)
    return

def main():
  dev = Developer()
  dev.code()
  dev.unSleep()
  dev.drinkCoffe()
  dev.code()

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```
